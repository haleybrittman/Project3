          <h2 id="steelpan">1. Using a Stainless Steel Pan</h2>
          <p>You might think this doesn't really belong in a "How To" guide, but there can be some nuance when it comes to using a stainless steel pan properly - specifically preventing sticking! Some people dont like using them because of the innate nature of food sticking to the pan, but there is a method to preventing this for the most part.</p>
          <p id="bold">Step 1: Heating your pan</p>
          <p>This step is most crucial. Turn on your stove to high heat and wait for 3 or so minutes (you may need longer). Now take a very small amount of water and pour it into the pan. If the water beads up in the pan and dances around, your pan is ready! If the water starts to sizzle quickly and evaporates then the pan is not hot enough yet so you'll have to leave it for a bit longer.</p>
          <p>Step 2: You can now put the oil in the pan. I'd recommend turning down the pan by this point (unless you like burnt food)</p>
          <p>Thats about it honestly - these steps are meant to minimize sticking as much as possible - its all in the prep!</p>

          <h2 id="smoothie">2. Make a Protein Packed Smoothie Bowl without Protein Powder!</h2>
          <p>If you're like me you have a dislike for protein powder due to its taste/texture but still want to have a protien packed treat then this is for you!</p>
          <p>Here are the basic ingredients you'll need:</p>
          <ul id="ingredient-list">
            <li>Frozen fruit of your choice</li>
            <li>Low fat Plain Greek Yogurt</li>
            <li>Hemp Seeds</li>
            <li>Chia seeds</li>
            <li>Optional: Ice</li>
          </ul>
          <p id="empathis">Why use Non-fat instead of Whole Milk?</p>
          <p>Good question. Whole milk greek yogurt has less protien compared to non-fat greek yogurt and more calories. You are free to use whole milk but it will have a little less protein in it.</p>
          <p>In terms of portioning I'd recommend that you follow the serving size of each ingredient and add more from there. You can see the following for the nutrition per serving for each brand I'd use for this recipe:</p>
          <ul id="nutrition-list">
            <li>Chobani Low fat Plain Greek Yogurt = 170g (serving size), 16 grams of protien, 90 cals</li>
            <li>Manitoba Harvest Hemp Seeds = 30g (serving size), 10 grams of protien, 180 cals</li>
            <li>Chia seeds = 2.5 tablespoons (serving size) 140 calories, 5 grams of protien, 140 cals</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Step 1: Get your blender</p>
          <p>Step 2: Put the fruit and seeds in the blender first and then add the greek yogurt.</p>
          <p>Step 3: Now you can turn on the blender. Note: you may need to stop the blender to give it a shake or two if the blades start having a hard time blending.</p>
          <p>The ingredients I mentioned are meant to prioritize protien but whats a smoothie bowl if its too liquidy? If the smoothie is too liquidy for your liking, you can add ice and oats to it as well.</p>
          <p>Step 4: Dump the contents into a bowl and top off with whatever topping you like (honey, granola, etc - I like Bear Naked's vanilla granola!)</p>
          <p>Enjoy!!</p>
